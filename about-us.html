              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/terminal2.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>The building blocks of Thaleria date back to 2014 when we tried to imagine what an ideal version of IT
                consulting could look like. We launched a first iteration through a partnership in the European
                Institutions market, which although very successful was also far from perfect. The founding principles
                were sound, but the growth of the company outpaced its processes. The team gradually improved the model
                over 4 years, but it still felt like an upgrade was needed – a v2.0 was a natural evolution.</p>
            </li>

              <h4>Development</h4>
              <p class="small-2"><time datetime="2017-08-17">October-December 2018</time></p>
              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/blocks.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>In October 2018 the team started working on Thaleria as an extension of the model to the private
                market. This was the perfect opportunity to go back to the drawing board and start with a clean slate.
                The last quarter of 2018 was spent reviewing the founding principles, building a new infrastructure and
                troubleshooting processes and best practices. After ironing out the kinks and quirks, Thaleria
                officially launched its operations.</p>

              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/rocket2.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>With a working, competitive and reliable model, Thaleria launched full-scale activities within the IT
                Services market in January 2019. We hope our battle-tested principles and processes are a positive
                force in the development of both our clients and consultants – all the while keeping a solemn
                commitment to continuous improvement by listening to the market’s feedback.</p>

              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/digital.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>As IT Services grows, Thaleria is already preparing an offering for the Digital Marketing sector. As
                the world becomes increasingly connected, Thaleria recognizes both the importance and the challenges
                that many of our partners face in adapting and finding the right resources in this field. The launch of
                this business line is scheduled for April 2019.</p>

              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/management.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>Thaleria being born of a very specific expertise, it only makes sense to share that expertise with our
                partners and clients too. Thaleria intends on empowering its partners by sharing its best practices and
                its competitive edge. Our offering will start with our core expertise, in the form of building
                comprehensive HR strategies to help our partners face the challenges of talent-driven markets.</p>

              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/labs.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>Thaleria Labs will be the branch of the company dedicated to R&D, start-up incubation and rapid
                iteration of concepts and ideas. Naturally a certain scale is required for resources to be available
                for this, but Thaleria is already accompanying at least one start-up in its development (Paintify), and
                already is already pursuing business development efforts in the AI and Blockchain sectors ahead of its
                launch in 2020.</p>

              <p><img class="rounded shadow-3" src="assets/img/vector/foundation.png" alt="..."></p>
              <p>Thaleria has always believed that the business community has an enormous responsibility in shaping the
                society and world we live in. From the first day Thaleria was founded, 20% of every euro we make is
                allocated to a Social Responsibility Fund which will be used for social impact projects. While the Fund
                grows through 2019-2020, it will be picked up for use in January 2021 by the Thaleria Foundation.</p>
